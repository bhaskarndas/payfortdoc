This section helps you to integrate PayFORT Android SDK with your android project and develop a a payment system for your mobile application. To process a transaction using the FORT Mobile SDK, create a Mobile SDK Token and proceed through the following sections. Please refer to the SDK Token section by visiting this link About the PayFORT Android SDK List of Supported Platforms The FORT Mobile SDK supports all devices running Android 4.1.x (API level 16). ICE CREAM SANDWICH or higher are supported. This release supports Android Pie API 28. Localization Support The FORT Mobile SDK supports both English and Arabic languages. Screen Orientation Portrait is the only orientation supported within the FORT Mobile SDK. Supported Payment Methods Through the first version of the FORT Mobile SDK, the Merchant has the ability to process a CREDIT CARD transactions only. Supported Payment Options The supported credit card payment options are VISA , MASTERCARD , American Express (AMEX) , MADA and MEEZA . Android Integration Flow Placeholder : Explain the Integration Flow with diagram. Setting up Development Environment Prerequisites You are required to download the FORT android sdk from this link . You can select either eclipse or android studio for your development setup. You are also required to have some knowledge of mobile app development. You are also required to generate SDK Token. IDE Configurations To start using the FORT Mobile SDK, Please follow the steps: Placeholder: Provide the pic Download the SDK and extract the SDK. The folder contains Dependencies , Res and FORTSDKv1.5.aar-release . Dependencies folder includes: Eclipse folder : .jar files for the SDK dependencies. LINKS_README text file that contains a list for sources of the above jars and a list of required libraries to be added as dependencies as well (Manual configuration). AndroidStudio_gradle text file which adds the compile command for what your project does not include. Res folder : Layout Layout-ar FORTSDKv1.5.aar-release Please make sure to read our notes according to the IDE you are using whether it\u2019s the Android Studio or Eclipse. Android Studio Project Setup Once you have downloaded and extracted the PayFORT SDK as explained above you can next setup the Android Studio. To continue the integration, please proceed with the following steps: Go to File \u2192 New \u2192 New Module. Placeholder: Pictures of Android Studio for each step. Select \u201cImport .JAR/.AAR Package\u201d and click next. Enter the path to .aar file and click finish. Browse to the dependencies folder and open the \u201cAndroidStudio_gradle\u201d text file. Copy and paste the implementation/ api lines that are NOT already supported in your dependency block. (All listed dependencies are required). Click the \u201cSync the project with gradle files\u201d button. Clean the project. The SDK is now ready for your use. Eclipse Project Setup Incase you are using Eclipse instead of Android Studio then you can ignore the above section and follow the instructions in this section. The integration will include two main steps. For the first step, you need to create a library project by following the below steps: Create a new project (from this time it\u2019s called \u201clibrary project\u201d) in your workspace. Placeholder: Provide picture of Eclipse platform for each step. Do not forget to mark it as library. Clear the src folder of the library project. Unzip the .aar file. You can rename it to zip and then unzip it or use any tool. Copy the classes.jar file to libs folder on the library project. Replace the res folder on library project with the res folder of the .aar file. Project Configuration Once the IDEs have been installed, next we will configure the project. This section discusses the steps to configure the Project. The configuration will help to integrate the PayFORT android SDK with the IDE. The project you have created contains almost everything you need. Now let\u2019s start configuring your project to reference this library project by following the below points: Placeholder: Provide pictures for project configuration. In the target project, use the library created in step one (mentioned above) as a dependency. Open the AndroidManifest.xml file inside .aar file and make sure to copy everything it takes (permissions, activities, services, receivers \u2026) in the AndroidManifest.xml file of the target project. Copy the entire contents (if any) inside the assets folder of the .aar file to the assets folder of the target project. Copy the entire contents (if any) inside the libs folder of the .aar file to the libs folder of the target project. Open the dependencies file \u2192 Eclipse, then copy all .jar files and add them to the libs folder of the target project. Check if your target project has the project dependencies included in the LINKS_README text file under the LINKS_README text file under the libraries (Projects/aar). Otherwise use the links included in the previously mentioned file and add them as a dependency project on your target project. Clean and rebuild your target project. OS Permissions The PayFORT android SDK requires the following android OS permissions to work properly as shown by the following code. You are required to include the below code in your project. <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\"/> <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE\"/> <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\"/> Using the FORT Mobile SDK Collect the FORT Mobile SDK Request Through a Java Bean You can create a Java bean class for the PayFORT Mobile SDK request as shown below: // FORT Mobile SDK request public class FortRequest implements Serializable{ private Map<String, Object> requestMap; private boolean showResponsePage; public Map<String, Object> getRequestMap() { return requestMap; } public void setRequestMap(Map<String, Object> requestMap) { this.requestMap = requestMap; } public boolean isShowResponsePage() { return showResponsePage; } public void setShowResponsePage(boolean showResponsePage) { this.showResponsePage = showResponsePage; } } The following are the Mobile SDK Call Parameters: The \u201crequestMap\u201d will contain all the PayFORT parameters of the order/ transaction. \u201cshowResponsePage\u201d is the Boolean field where you can determine if you want the FORT response page to be displayed or not. Define a Callback Manager Define and initialize an instance of the FortCallBackManager in your activity as shown below: // FORT Callback Manager Instance private FortCallBackManager fortCallback = null; fortCallback = FortCallback.Factory.create(); Attach the Callback to the Activity You need to add the statement that appears below to the onActivityResult function. //Callback Statement @Override protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) { super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data); fortCallback.onActivityResult(requestCode,resultCode,data); } Call the FORT Mobile SDK For every transaction that needs to be processed, do the call as shown below and handle the callback methods upon your business flow. The FORT Mobile SDK Call registers a new callback for a new request. The registerCallBack requires the inputs as shown below. //FORT Mobile SDK Call FortSdk.getInstance().registerCallback(this,fortRequest,5, fortCallback, showLoading, new FortInterfaces.OnTnxProcessed() { @Override public void onCancel(Map<String, Object> requestParamsMap,Map<String, Object> responseMap) { //TODO: handle me } @Override public void onSuccess(Map<String, Object> requestParamsMap, Map<String, Object> fortResponseMap) { //TODO: handle me } @Override public void onFailure(Map<String, Object> requestParamsMap, Map<String, Object> fortResponseMap) { //TODO: handle me } @Override public void onSuccess(Map<String, Object> requestParamsMap, Map<String, Object> fortResponseMap) { //TODO: handle me } }); Register Callback Request //The registerCallBack Request public void registerCallback( Activity context, final FortRequest fortRequest, String environment, final int requestCode, final FortCallBackManager callbackManager, boolean showLoading, final FortInterfaces.OnTnxProcessed callback) Call the Fort SDK Function //FortSDK function String device_id = FortSdk.getDeviceId(this); FORT Mobile SDK Device ID Value Please Make sure to use the FortSDK function as shown above to generate the device_id parameter value that must be used for creating the sdk_token from your business security server. The Merchant can choose to display the FORT response page by passing \u201cshowResponsePage\u201d value as \u201cTrue\u201d. Customizing the Mobile SDK Payment Layout We provide you with the res folder that includes the source code of the pages in order to customize the design, themes, etc. You can customize both English and Arabic layouts as needed. However, please take the following tips into consideration: Placeholder: Provide Android UI flow diagrams and Android based mobile screenshots. Don\u2019t change the layout name because it\u2019s considered an override process. Make sure to use all the views that has the ID property in order to avoid the NullPointerException. Redesign the view for portrait orientation. Note that Landscape orientation isn\u2019t supported. You can support as much layout densities as you want. Don\u2019t forget to redesign the layout-ar file too (right-to-left). Don\u2019t change, rename, or remove onClick functions. Our Mobile SDK v 1.5 consists one of the following three main activities design: activity_cc_payment.xml activity_cc_response.xml activity_init_secure_conn Every file is available for both English and Arabic alignments; layout and layout-ar. The files Hierarchy and Content might change in our SDK\u2019s future versions. Design Customization Codes: The following code was used to customize the way the \u201cAmount\u201d is displayed in the Standard Mobile SDK Payment Page: <TextView android:id=\u201c@+id/amountTV\u201d android:layout_width=\u201cmatch_parent\u201d android:layout_height=\u201c@dimen/pf_payment_type_header_height\u201d android:background=\u201c@color/pf_light_gray\u201d android:gravity=\u201ccenter_horizontal|center_vertical\u201d android:textColor=\u201c@android:color/black\u201d android:textSize=\u201c@dimen/pf_15_txt_size\u201d /> The following code is used to customize the way the \u201cAmount\u201d is displayed in the Customized Mobile SDK Payment Page: LinearLayout android:layout_width=\u201cmatch_parent\u201d android:layout_height=\u201cwrap_content\u201d android:orientation=\u201chorizontal\u201d android:padding=\u201c10dp\u201d android:background=\u201c@android:color/white\u201d> <ImageView android:layout_width=\u201c40dp\u201d android:layout_height=\u201c40dp\u201d android:src=\u201c@drawable/merchant_logo\u201d/> <TextView android:fontFamily=\u201csans-serif-medium\u201d android:text=\u201cMerchant name\u201d android:layout_margin=\u201c10dp\u201d android:textColor=\u201c@android:color/holo_blue_dark\u201d android:layout_width=\u201cwrap_content\u201d android:layout_gravity=\u201ccenter_vertical\u201d android:layout_height=\u201cwrap_content\u201d android:src=\u201c@drawable/merchant_logo\u201d/> <TextView android:id=\u201c@+id/amountTV\u201d android:layout_width=\u201cmatch_parent\u201d android:layout_height=\u201c@dimen/pf_payment_type_header_height\u201d android:gravity=\u201cright|center_vertical\u201d android:textColor=\u201c@android:color/black\u201d android:text=\u201c100 UDS\u201d android:textSize=\u201c@dimen/pf_15_txt_size\u201d /> </LinearLayout> As appears in the previous codes, elements with IDs haven\u2019t been changed in type or removed. For example: android:id=\u201c@+id/amountTV\u201d. We were able to add static elements such as: ImageView element that contains the Merchant\u2019s logo, and TextView that contains the Merchant\u2019s name. To sum up, you can add any static elements or redesign the view, while keeping the views\u2019 elements used in the Standard layout that hold IDs. Make sure to retest your custom design, for example, by showing the error messages on fields and applying the changes to the Arabic layout. (Refer to the points mentioned under the **Customizing the Mobile SDK Payment Layout** section). The customized XML file should be added to the layout file in the target project (Merchant Application) to override the SDK file. PayFORT Android SDK Operations Once you have done the project setup and installation, you will be performing the Operations for authorization and purchase done through mobile application. These operations helps your mobile application to process Authorization and Purchase operations. You will be sending the request parameters in your code which will be sent to the PayFORT server and your application will receive response from the PayFORT server.

PayFORT Android SDK \u2013 Device ID permission This section helps the developers to understand the need and usage of the permission requested by the PayFORT Payment SDK to generate a unique device ID. You might not face this issue through your payment flow. It depends on the time you are requesting the getDeviceID function and ask about the permission for the first time. A part of the FORT mobile SDK flow is to get a unique ID for the device. Generating the ID based on more than one input (collecting as much as possible will lead to a real unique ID). The Telephone manager is one of these sources. Accessing the Telephone manager need the use of \u2018android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE\u2019 permission. According to Android that\u2019s a dangerous permission to be used. Getting the needed permission through the flow on the case of getting the client granted that will produce a miss match device ID on the 1st SDK call. To avoid the mismatch flow we are suggesting you the following solutions: Handle the 1st SDK call in the onActivityResults(). Since The FORT SDK is a module running within the main application context the requested permission response will be returned to the merchant context. Once the activity that called geDeviceId for the 1st received a call-back in the onActivityResult() with request code = 222 you can for sure starts the payment flow of creating an SDK token and calling the SDK afterwards. Call getDeviceID on a previous activity or in your application class to make sure that the permission request was triggered before you reach the payment step.

The services provided by PayFort are: Fraud Prevention. 3-D Secure. Installments. Tokenization. Batch service. Remember - If you wish to activate extra services for your Merchant account, you need to contact PayFort\u2019s Back-office team. For detailed information, please download our Merchant Integration Guide and read the \u201cServices Activation\u201d section to guide you through this process. Signature The Signature is a parameter that holds the digital signature value calculated by the SHA algorithm. The digital signature is used to authenticate the sender and receiver of the message and allows the receiver to verify the integrity of the message. Message Digest Name Description SHA Type The Secure Hash Algorithm is a family of cryptographic hash functions published by the National Institute of Standards as a US Federal information processing standard (FIPS) including: SHA-0, SHA-2, and SHA-3. Values: SHA-256, SHA 512, and SHA-128 (not recommended). SHA Request Phrase This value is used when the Merchant generates the request signature. Values: Dynamic value defined by the Merchant. SHA Response Phrase This value is used by our system to generate the response signature for the Merchant\u2019s Request. Values: Dynamic value defined by the Merchant. Signature Pattern The below steps describe the signature pattern: Sort all PayFort requests parameters (both mandatory and optional) in an ascending alphabetical order based on the parameters names. Concatenate the parameter name with the value separated by \u2019=\u2019 (param_name=param_value). Concatenate all the parameters directly without any separator. (param_name1=param_value1param_name2=param_value2). Add the Merchant\u2019s Passphrase at the beginning and end of the parameters string. (REQUESTPHRASEparam_name1=param_value1param_name2=param_value2RE QUESTPHRASE). Use the SHA function to generate the SHA value of the resulted string depending on the type of SHA selected by the Merchant. Create Signature Value Map<String, Object>requestMap = new HashedMap(); requestMap.put(\"command\", \"PURCHASE\"); requestMap.put(\"merchant_reference\", \"Test010\"); requestMap.put(\"amount\", \"1000\"); requestMap.put(\"access_code\", \"SILgpo7pWbmzuURp2qri\"); requestMap.put(\"merchant_identifier\", \"MxvOupuG\"); requestMap.put(\"currency\", \"USD\"); requestMap.put(\"language\", \"en\"); requestMap.put(\"customer_email\", \"test@gmail.com\"); //order by key requestMap = requestMap.entrySet().stream().sorted(Map.Entry.comparingByKey()) .collect(Collectors.toMap(Map.Entry::getKey, Map.Entry::getValue, (oldValue, newValue) -> oldValue, LinkedHashMap::new)); String requestString = \"PASS\"; for(Entry<String, Object> entry: requestMap.entrySet()) requestString += entry.getKey() + \"=\" + entry.getValue(); requestString+= \"PASS\"; MessageDigest digest = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\"); byte[] hashed = digest.digest(requestString.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)); String signature = javax.xml.bind.DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary(hashed); In this section, you can find examples on how to create the signature value for request and response messages. Please note that all values mentioned in the examples are fictitious. The following is an example of the Request Parameters: signature = b88db48baaa600c3fadac502c75a832e3470029f command = PURCHASE merchant_reference = Test010 amount = 1000 access_code = SILgpo7pWbmzuURp2qri merchant_identifier = MxvOupuG currency = USD language = en customer_email = test@gmail.com Below are the Merchant signature settings from the back-office: SHA Request Phrase: PASS. SHA-Type: SHA-256. After sorting the parameters and completing step 4 of the Signature Pattern , the result will be the following concatenated string: PASSaccess_code=SILgpo7pWbmzuURp2qriamount=1000command=PURCHASEcurrenc y=USDcustomer_email=test@gmail.comlanguage=enmerchant_identifier=MxvOupuGmerch ant_reference=Test010PASS After applying step 5 of the Signature Pattern , the result will be as follows: Signature = 94C38AFC7BDAE0114FC8C740EDF12416F22998241CE4B4EA70D5521233A2C882 The following is an example for the Merchant Page 2.0 request signature calculations: Remember - The calculations for the Merchant Page 2.0 require you to calculate the signature without including the following parameters in the signature even if these parameters included in the request of Merchant Page 2.0: card_security_code, card_number, expiry_date, card_holder_name, remember_me.

With the help of PayFORT you can collect payment information conveniently and securely. It offers your customer the choice to pay in multiple currencies. Your customers can also select from available payment methods such as 3D secure, Apple Pay, Visa Checkout or MasterPass. You can get started with a PayFORT test account by signing up using this link If you want to integrate payment systems with your site then you can sign up for a live account by visiting this link Endpoints An endpoint is one end of a communication channel and your merchant site will communicate with the PayFORT resources using Endpoints. For PayFORT APIs , an endpoint includes a URL of PayFORT server or service. Sandbox POST https://sbcheckout.payfort.com/FortAPI/paymentPage Live POST https://checkout.payfort.com/FortAPI/paymentPage Give It a Try Use one of our test cards and corresponding CVV to try iFrames out for yourself. You can use any expiry date (`mm/yy`), as long as it's in the future. PayFORT offers you two approaches for integrations with your merchant site as mentioned below: Merchant Page Integration There are two ways to integrate Merchant pages Merchant Page 1 Merchant Page 2 What is iFrame for Web? You can setup payment form and start accepting payments within few minutes with the help of iFrame. PayFORT provides easy to use iFrame which can be easily integrated with your payment form. It takes the look and feel of your merchant site and accepts payments from major credit cards including MADA, VISA, Mastercard, etc. You develop your site in any technology of your choice and integrate the iFrame in your html based checkout page. The PayFORT iframe takes the look and feel as that of your website. Figure 1 - Using PayFORT iFrame for web How it Works? Your checkout page will display an integrated PayFORT iFrame to your Customer that has the same look and feel as that of your website. Customer fills his/her payment details in the checkout page. PayFORT server receives the payment details and validates the same. PayFORT then sends a token to your checkout page to complete the transaction. You have the option to redirect the Customer directly to the checkout page. For more details on Tokens and Tokenization process visit the Link Integration Flow Figure 2 : Integration Flow using iFrame Here is the description of the PayFORT iFrame Integration workflow : The customer begins the checkout process on your website. The payment page with integrated iFrame is displayed. The Customer then enters the card\u2019s details on the payment page. PayFORT checks the card details. PayFORT creates a token for the Customer transaction and sends it to the payment page. The Payment page then sends a JSON request along with the token to PayFORT. In case your page receives from PayFORT server a 3-D Secure URL 3ds_url , and response indicating that a 3ds check is required then: Your payment page redirects the Customer to the ACS to check his card enrollment. The Customer enters authentication data on the ACS platform. The ACS performs authentication of the Customer\u2019s data and sends the authentication results to PayFORT. PayFORT completes the operation based on the 3-D Secure response and returns the response to your payment page. PayFORT sends the payment results to your site. In case of 3ds secure check, PayFort returns status 20: On hold and message 064: 3-D Secure check requested message.For example, PayFort is waiting for your payment page to authenticate the Customer. If you include the token_name parameter in the request and this Token already has a successful Authorization, then the card number (masked) and expiry date will be displayed in their allocated fields. If the Token is sent by you, it will be generated with the same name as sent by your page. Payment processing page, payment form and payment details form all refer to payment page on your site where customer will enter card details. For more details on Tokens and Tokenization process visit the Link Integrate iFrames to Payment Page If you are planning to use PayFORT iFrames then you can use the endpoints Endpoints for testing and and also for going live. You can use programming language of your choice or what your site uses and can use the iFrame in your html based check out page. Before you start Make sure you have your access_code . Refer to Figure 3 . You can find it in the backoffice , under Integration Settings > Security Settings > Access Code . If you don't have an account with us yet, you can create a test account by visiting the Link . You can also get started with an active account by visiting this link . Once you signup you will get the access to the Backoffice. You can check out more about navigating through backoffice by visiting this link Figure 3 : Access Code Generation The Payment Page Template available in the backoffice provides you the feature to create a payment processing page using PayFort iFrame. Refer to the Figure 4 Figure 4 : Use Payment Settings to create a payment form Sample iFrame code snippet The following sample code snippet is the start of the payment process and allows you to tokenize a customer's sensitive card information using iFrames. <html> </head> <body> <iframe style=\"border:5px dotted red\" name=\"myframe\" src = \"\" width=\"400\" height=\"600\"> </iframe> <form action=\"https://sbcheckout.payfort.com/FortAPI/paymentPage\" method=\"post\" id=\"\" target=\"myframe\"> <INPUT type=\"hidden\" NAME=\"service_command\" value=\"TOKENIZATION\"> <INPUT type=\"hidden\" NAME=\"language\" value=\" \"> <INPUT type=\"hidden\" NAME=\"merchant_identifier\" value=\"\"> <INPUT type=\"hidden\" NAME=\"access_code\" value=\"\"> <INPUT type=\"hidden\" NAME=\"signature\" value=\"\"> <INPUT type=\"hidden\" NAME=\"return_url\" value=\"\"> <INPUT type=\"hidden\" NAME=\"merchant_reference\" value=\"\"> <input value=\"Send\" type=\"submit\" id=\"form1\"> </form> </body> </html> The above code snippet is an HTML based form that will post a request to PayFORT server. The request parameters are also added in the input tag of the code. However, If you are not familiar with HTML tags and forms then you can checkout this site The parameters are mandatory and are required by PayFORT server to validate, authenticate and provide the tokens for processing of payment The form consists of iframe tag which specifies the style, name of the style (you can give any name to your style), source code location, width and height of the iframe. All these are customizable values which you can provide. The form action tag consists of the endpoints . This will come handy whenever submit action is performed on the page. Once the form is submitted the parameters provided in the form would be sent to the PayFORT server and Endpoints will serve as communication link between your page and PayFORT server. Here is the description of the input parameters: The very first input parameter is the service command Tokenization.

The prerequisites are the apple machine. You can chose to write the program either in Objective-C or in Swift programming which is the latest programming by the apple development community. The below steps describes the project setup for both objective-c and swift programming. Placeholder: please provide pics for every step described in this section. Download the sdk from this link and extract it. Drag the PayFortSDK.framework & PayFortSDK.bundle to Frameworks in Project Navigator. Create a new group Frameworks if it does not exist: Choose Create groups for any added folders. Make Sure to select Copy files if needed. Set -ObjC in the Other Linker Flags in the Target \u2192 Build Settings Tab. For Swift Projects add the following code In your Bridge-Header.h: #import <PayFortSDK/PayFortSDK.h> Ensure the option 'Link With Standard Libraries' is set to Yes or just drag the PayFortSDK to Embedded Binaries in the general tab in the project settings. In Xcode, click your project\u2019s .plist file and select Open As \u2192 Source Code. Insert the following XML snippet into the body of your file just before the final: </dict>element <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key> <dict> <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key><true/> </dict> To ensure that the application is not disconnected go to background make sure to add this code:Objective C (void)applicationDidEnterBackground:(UIApplication *)application { __block UIBackgroundTaskIdentifier backgroundTask; backgroundTask = [application beginBackgroundTaskWithExpirationHandler: ^ { [application endBackgroundTask:backgroundTask]; backgroundTask = UIBackgroundTaskInvalid; }]; Swift func applicationDidEnterBackground(_ application: UIApplication) { var bgTask: UIBackgroundTaskIdentifier = 0 bgTask = application.beginBackgroundTask(expirationHandler: { application.endBackgroundTask(bgTask) bgTask = UIBackgroundTaskInvalid }) } Installation of PayFORT SDK When you register for Payfort, you will receive separate keys for testing and production environment.

The response(along with message success, failed or cancelled) will be already in the registered call back handler. The response can be viewed in the log as shown below for both objective C and swift programming: Objective C [payFort callPayFortWithRequest:request currentViewController:self Success:^(NSDictionary *requestDic, NSDictionary *responeDic) { NSLog(@\u201cSuccess\u201d); NSLog(@\u201crequestDic=%@\u201d,requestDic); NSLog(@\u201cresponeDic=%@\u201d,responeDic); } Canceled:^(NSDictionary *requestDic, NSDictionary *responeDic) { NSLog(@\u201cCanceled\u201d); NSLog(@\u201crequestDic=%@\u201d,requestDic); NSLog(@\u201cresponeDic=%@\u201d,responeDic); } Faild:^(NSDictionary *requestDic, NSDictionary *responeDic, NSString *message) { NSLog(@\u201cFaild\u201d); NSLog(@\u201crequestDic=%@\u201d,requestDic); NSLog(@\u201cresponeDic=%@\u201d,responeDic); NSLog(@\u201cmessage=%@\u201d,message); }]; Swift PayFort.callPayFort(withRequest: request, currentViewController: self, success: { (requestDic, responeDic) in print(\u201csuccess\u201d) print(\u201cresponeDic=(responeDic)\u201d) print(\u201cresponeDic=(responeDic)\u201d) }, canceled: { (requestDic, responeDic) in print(\u201ccanceled\u201d) print(\u201crequestDic=(requestDic)\u201d) print(\u201cresponeDic=(responeDic)\u201d) }, faild: { (requestDic, responeDic, message) in print(\u201cfaild\u201d) print(\u201crequestDic=(requestDic)\u201d) print(\u201cresponeDic=(responeDic)\u201d) print(\u201cmessage=(message)\u201d) }) If you do not want to investigate logs for response message you have the option to show response in the view directly in an elegant manner by displaying the response results as success or failed. You can check the sample code in objective c and swift programming to display the response message as shown below: Objective C PayFort.IsShowResponsePage = YES; Swift PayFort.IsShowResponsePage = true; Hidden PayFort loading There is an option to hide loading view when SDK initializes the connection request. You can disable the loading view by setting HideLoading option to yes or true as shown in the sample code. If you are using Objective C then you have to set it to yes and if you are using swift you have to set it to true. Please refer to below piece of code. Objective C PayFort.HideLoading = YES; Swift PayFort.HideLoading = true; Custom Payment Designing The payment view is what your customer will see when they open your merchant app on their cellphone and payment view will help them to make payment through your application. You can create your own custom UI theme for the payment view by the following ways: Create your nibFile .xib and set the name of Arabic xib same name with English one with suffix -ar. Link the xib with PayFortView and bind all the IBOutlets in interface section as shown in the code example below IBOutlet UILabel *titleLbl; IBOutlet UIButton *BackBtn; IBOutlet UILabel *PriceLbl; IBOutlet JVFloatLabeledTextField *CardNameTxt; IBOutlet JVFloatLabeledTextField *CardNumberTxt; IBOutlet JVFloatLabeledTextField *CVCNumberTxt; IBOutlet JVFloatLabeledTextField *ExpDateTxt; IBOutlet UILabel *cardNumberErrorlbl; IBOutlet UILabel *cVCNumberErrorlbl; IBOutlet UILabel *expDateErrorlbl; IBOutlet UISwitch *savedCardSwitch; IBOutlet UIButton *paymentBtn; IBOutlet UILabel *saveCardLbl; IBOutlet UIImageView *imageCard; Placeholder: please provide UI flow diagram alongwith iphone screenshot for the same. Assign new created xib file to PayFort Controller. [payFort setPayFortCustomViewNib:@\u201cPayFortView2\u201d]; If you call Arabic view and the Arabic view does not exist then the application will crash. Don\u2019t forget to set the custom view field in the identity inspector. PayFORT iOS SDK Operations Once you have done the project setup and installation, you will be performing the Operations for authorization and purchase done through mobile application. These operations helps your mobile application to process Authorization and Purchase operations. You will be sending the request parameters in your code which will be sent to the PayFORT server and your application will receive response from the PayFORT server.

It allows the receiver to verify the Integrity of the message. In this case your site acts as sender while PayFort server acts as a receiver thus by passing the signature parameter it is ensured that high level of security is in place when the message is sent and received. It also ensures that all the messages sent are encrypted using the signature. Below table describes the signature details Signature Description Name Values Description SHA Type * SHA-256 * SHA-512 The Secure Hash Algorithm is a family of cryptographic hash functions published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as a U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS), including: SHA-0, SHA-1, SHA-2, SHA-3. SHA Request Phrase Dynamic value defined by the Merchant This value is used when the Merchant generates the request signature. SHA Response Phrase Dynamic value defined by the Merchant This value is used by our system to generate the response signature for the Merchant's Request. Signature Pattern The below steps describe the signature pattern: Sort all PayFort requests parameters (both mandatory and optional) in an ascending alphabetical order based on the parameters names. Concatenate the parameter name with the value separated by '=' (param_name=param_value). Concatenate all the parameters directly without any separator. (param_name1=param_value1param_name2=param_value2). Add the Merchant's Passphrase at the beginning and end of the parameters string. (REQUESTPHRASEparam_name1=param_value1param_name2=param_value2REQUESTP HRASE). Use the SHA function to generate the SHA value of the resulted string depending on the type of SHA selected by the Merchant. The following is an example for the Customer Verification - Request signature calculations : Assume you have the below parameters included in the request of customer verification: service_command = CUSTOMER_VERIFY merchant_identifier = CycHZxVj merchant_reference = XYZ9239-yu898 access_code = zx0IPmPy5jp1vAz8Kpg7 language = en payment_option = VALU phone_number = 00008557694 Below are the Merchant signature settings from the back-office: SHA Request Phrase: PASS SHA-Type: SHA-256 The string to hash should be prepared for the above request is the following \u201cstep 4 of the Signature Pattern\u201d: PASSaccess_code=zx0IPmPy5jp1vAz8Kpg7language=enmerchant_identifier=CycHZxVjmerchant_reference=X YZ9239- yu898payment_option=VALUphone_number=00008557694service_command=CUSTOMER_VERIFYPASS After applying step 5 of the Signature pattern, the result will be as follows: Signature = f0c49b9dae92b3da04d82689f698189ac65f62596280cd253cb24130ce5a1ed6 The following is an example for the OTP Generation \u2013 Request signature calculations: Assume you have the below parameters included in the request of generate OTP: service_command = OTP_GENERATE access_code = zx0IPmPy5jp1vAz8Kpg7 merchant_identifier = CycHZxVj merchant_reference = XYZ9239-yu898 payment_option = VALU phone_number = 00008557694 merchant_order_id = Valu123 amount = 10000 currency = EGP products = [ { \"product_name\":\"iphone\", \"product_price\":\"10000\", \"product_category\":\"phone\" } ] Below are the Merchant signature settings from the back-office: SHA Request Phrase: PASS SHA-Type: SHA-256 The string to hash should be prepared for the above request is the following \u201cstep 4 of the Signature Pattern\u201d: To calculate the products parameter in the signature: products = [ {\"product_name\":\"iphone\", \"product_price\":\"10000\", \"product_category\":\"phone\" } ] It should look like as shown below: products=[{product_name=iphone, product_price=10000, product_category=phone}] PASSaccess_code=zx0IPmPy5jp1vAz8Kpg7amount=10000currency=EGPlanguage=enmerchant_identifier=Cy cHZxVjmerchant_order_id=Valu123merchant_reference=XYZ9239- yu898payment_option=VALUphone_number=00008557694products=[{product_name=iphone, product_price=10000, product_category=phone}]service_command=OTP_GENERATEPASS After applying step 5 of the Signature pattern, the result will be as follows: Signature = c9a58adbe7fa5311b79a6362f28aa3e02c10cde5a37f10456e1caa6bd06a6951 Transaction\u2019s Response Codes Please visit the link to check the transaction codes and messages related to ValU service.

It allows the receiver to verify the Integrity of the message. In this case your site acts as sender while PayFort server acts as a receiver thus by passing the signature parameter it is ensured that high level of security is in place when the message is sent and received. It also ensures that all the messages sent are encrypted using the signature. Below table describes the signature details Signature Description Name Values Description SHA Type * SHA-256 * SHA-512 The Secure Hash Algorithm is a family of cryptographic hash functions published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as a U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS), including: SHA-0, SHA-1, SHA-2, SHA-3. SHA Request Phrase Dynamic value defined by the Merchant This value is used when the Merchant generates the request signature. SHA Response Phrase Dynamic value defined by the Merchant This value is used by our system to generate the response signature for the Merchant's Request. Signature Pattern The below steps describe the signature pattern: Sort all PayFort requests parameters (both mandatory and optional) in an ascending alphabetical order based on the parameters names. Concatenate the parameter name with the value separated by '=' (param_name=param_value). Concatenate all the parameters directly without any separator. (param_name1=param_value1param_name2=param_value2). Add the Merchant's Passphrase at the beginning and end of the parameters string. (REQUESTPHRASEparam_name1=param_value1param_name2=param_value2REQUESTP HRASE). Use the SHA function to generate the SHA value of the resulted string depending on the type of SHA selected by the Merchant. The following is an example for the Customer Verification - Request signature calculations : Assume you have the below parameters included in the request of customer verification: service_command = CUSTOMER_VERIFY merchant_identifier = CycHZxVj merchant_reference = XYZ9239-yu898 access_code = zx0IPmPy5jp1vAz8Kpg7 language = en payment_option = VALU phone_number = 00008557694 Below are the Merchant signature settings from the back-office: SHA Request Phrase: PASS SHA-Type: SHA-256 The string to hash should be prepared for the above request is the following \u201cstep 4 of the Signature Pattern\u201d: PASSaccess_code=zx0IPmPy5jp1vAz8Kpg7language=enmerchant_identifier=CycHZxVjmerchant_reference=X YZ9239- yu898payment_option=VALUphone_number=00008557694service_command=CUSTOMER_VERIFYPASS After applying step 5 of the Signature pattern, the result will be as follows: Signature = f0c49b9dae92b3da04d82689f698189ac65f62596280cd253cb24130ce5a1ed6 The following is an example for the OTP Generation \u2013 Request signature calculations: Assume you have the below parameters included in the request of generate OTP: service_command = OTP_GENERATE access_code = zx0IPmPy5jp1vAz8Kpg7 merchant_identifier = CycHZxVj merchant_reference = XYZ9239-yu898 payment_option = VALU phone_number = 00008557694 merchant_order_id = Valu123 amount = 10000 currency = EGP products = [ { \"product_name\":\"iphone\", \"product_price\":\"10000\", \"product_category\":\"phone\" } ] Below are the Merchant signature settings from the back-office: SHA Request Phrase: PASS SHA-Type: SHA-256 The string to hash should be prepared for the above request is the following \u201cstep 4 of the Signature Pattern\u201d: To calculate the products parameter in the signature: products = [ {\"product_name\":\"iphone\", \"product_price\":\"10000\", \"product_category\":\"phone\" } ] It should look like as shown below: products=[{product_name=iphone, product_price=10000, product_category=phone}] PASSaccess_code=zx0IPmPy5jp1vAz8Kpg7amount=10000currency=EGPlanguage=enmerchant_identifier=Cy cHZxVjmerchant_order_id=Valu123merchant_reference=XYZ9239- yu898payment_option=VALUphone_number=00008557694products=[{product_name=iphone, product_price=10000, product_category=phone}]service_command=OTP_GENERATEPASS After applying step 5 of the Signature pattern, the result will be as follows: Signature = c9a58adbe7fa5311b79a6362f28aa3e02c10cde5a37f10456e1caa6bd06a6951 Transaction\u2019s Response Codes Please visit the link to check the transaction codes and messages related to ValU service.","title":"Signature"},{"location":"lendservice/#go-to-full-api","text":"Check out our full API by visiting this link","title":"Go to Full API"},{"location":"lendservice/#need-further-help","text":"Thanks for using PayFort.com.

You can setup payment form and start accepting payments with the help of PayFORT Merchant Page. Merchant Page Integration uses PayFORT iFrame which can be easily integrated with your payment form. It takes the look and feel of your merchant site and accepts payments from major credit cards including MADA, VISA, Mastercard, etc. You develop your site in any technology of your choice and integrate the iFrame in your html based checkout page. Figure 1 - Using PayFORT iFrame for web How it Works? Your checkout page will display an integrated PayFORT iFrame to your Customer that has the same look and feel as that of your website. Customer fills his/her payment details in the checkout page. PayFORT server receives the payment details and validates the same. PayFORT then sends a confirmation to your checkout page to complete the transaction. You have the option to redirect the Customer directly to the checkout page. Integration Flow Figure 2 : Integration Flow using iFrame Here is the description of the PayFORT iFrame Integration workflow : The customer begins the checkout process on your website. The payment page with integrated iFrame is displayed to the customer on the your site. The Customer then enters the card\u2019s details on the payment page. PayFORT checks the card details. PayFORT creates a token for the Customer transaction and sends it to the payment page. The Payment page then sends a JSON request along with the token to PayFORT. In case your page receives from PayFORT server a 3-D Secure URL 3ds_url , and response indicating that a 3ds check is required then: Your payment page redirects the Customer to the ACS to check his card enrollment. The Customer enters authentication data on the ACS platform. The ACS performs authentication of the Customer\u2019s data and sends the authentication results to PayFORT. PayFORT completes the operation based on the 3-D Secure response and returns the response to your payment page. PayFORT sends the payment results to your site. In case of 3ds secure check, PayFort returns status 20: On hold and message 064: 3-D Secure check requested message.For example, PayFort is waiting for your payment page to authenticate the Customer. If you include the token_name parameter in the request and this Token already has a successful Authorization, then the card number (masked) and expiry date will be displayed in their allocated fields. If the Token is sent by you, it will be generated with the same name as sent by your page. Payment processing page, payment form and payment details form all refer to payment page on your site where customer will enter card details. For more details on Tokens and Tokenization process visit the link Difference Between Merchant Page and Redirection Merchant Page Integration allows you to design a checkout page using PayFORT iframe where you can capture and verify the details of customer's credit card. The complete process involves displaying a checkout page to the customer where they will enter their credit card details and the details would be verified by the PayFORT servers and a token would be sent back to the merchant site which can be further used for carrying out check out process. Redirection involves authorizing a customer purchase. In this case amount for the purchase is hold for a particular period of time until it is captured or voided. If no action is taken by the merchant site then by default the amount is voided and refunded back to the card. For more details on redirection please visit the link Give It a Try Use one of our test cards and corresponding CVV to try iFrames out for yourself. You can use any expiry date ( mm/yy ), as long as it's in the future. Endpoints An endpoint is one end of a communication channel and your merchant site will communicate with the PayFORT resources using Endpoints. For PayFORT APIs , an endpoint includes a URL of PayFORT server or service. Sandbox Placeholder: provide correct sandbox url Live Placeholder: Provide correct live environment url Integrate iFrames to Payment Page If you are planning to use PayFORT iFrames then you can use the endpoints for testing and and also for going live. You can use programming language of your choice or what your site uses and can use the iFrame in your html based check out page. Before you start You need to signup for a test account or a live account with PayFORT. Once you signup you will get the access to the Backoffice. Make sure you have your access_code . Refer to Figure 3 . You can find it in the backoffice , under Integration Settings > Security Settings > Access Code .

PayFort processes the transaction and returns the results back to the Merchants through invisible redirection. Endpoints An endpoint is one end of a communication channel and your merchant site will communicate with the PayFORT resources using Endpoints. For PayFORT APIs , an endpoint includes a URL of PayFORT server or service. Sandbox POST https://sbcheckout.payfort.com/FortAPI/paymentPage Live POST https://checkout.payfort.com/FortAPI/paymentPage Merchant Page Integration There are two ways to integrate Merchant pages Merchant Page 1 Merchant Page 2 What is iFrame for Web? You can setup payment form and start accepting payments within few minutes with the help of iFrame. PayFORT provides easy to use iFrame which can be easily integrated with your payment form. It takes the look and feel of your merchant site and accepts payments from major credit cards including MADA, VISA, Mastercard, etc. You develop your site in any technology of your choice and integrate the iFrame in your html based checkout page. The PayFORT iframe takes the look and feel as that of your website. Figure 1 - Using PayFORT iFrame for web How it Works? Your checkout page will display an integrated PayFORT iFrame to your Customer that has the same look and feel as that of your website. Customer fills his/her payment details in the checkout page. PayFORT server receives the payment details and validates the same. PayFORT then sends a token to your checkout page to complete the transaction. You have the option to redirect the Customer directly to the checkout page. For more details on Tokens and Tokenization process visit the Link Integration Flow Figure 2 : Integration Flow using iFrame Here is the description of the PayFORT iFrame Integration workflow : The customer begins the checkout process on your website. The payment page with integrated iFrame is displayed. The Customer then enters the card\u2019s details on the payment page. PayFORT checks the card details. PayFORT creates a token for the Customer transaction and sends it to the payment page. The Payment page then sends a JSON request along with the token to PayFORT. In case your page receives from PayFORT server a 3-D Secure URL 3ds_url , and response indicating that a 3ds check is required then: Your payment page redirects the Customer to the ACS to check his card enrollment. The Customer enters authentication data on the ACS platform. The ACS performs authentication of the Customer\u2019s data and sends the authentication results to PayFORT. PayFORT completes the operation based on the 3-D Secure response and returns the response to your payment page. PayFORT sends the payment results to your site. In case of 3ds secure check, PayFort returns status 20: On hold and message 064: 3-D Secure check requested message.For example, PayFort is waiting for your payment page to authenticate the Customer. If you include the token_name parameter in the request and this Token already has a successful Authorization, then the card number (masked) and expiry date will be displayed in their allocated fields. If the Token is sent by you, it will be generated with the same name as sent by your page. Payment processing page, payment form and payment details form all refer to payment page on your site where customer will enter card details. For more details on Tokens and Tokenization process visit the Link Integrate iFrames to Payment Page If you are planning to use PayFORT iFrames then you can use the endpoints Endpoints for testing and and also for going live. You can use programming language of your choice or what your site uses and can use the iFrame in your html based check out page. Before you start Make sure you have your access_code . Refer to Figure 3 . You can find it in the backoffice , under Integration Settings > Security Settings > Access Code . If you don't have an account with us yet, you can create a test account by visiting the Link . You can also get started with an active account by visiting this link . Once you signup you will get the access to the Backoffice. You can check out more about navigating through backoffice by visiting this link Figure 3 : Access Code Generation The Payment Page Template available in the backoffice provides you the feature to create a payment processing page using PayFort iFrame. Refer to the Figure 4 Figure 4 : Use Payment Settings to create a payment form Sample iFrame code snippet The following sample code snippet is the start of the payment process and allows you to tokenize a customer's sensitive card information using iFrames. <html> </head> <body> <iframe style=\"border:5px dotted red\" name=\"myframe\" src = \"\" width=\"400\" height=\"600\"> </iframe> <form action=\"https://sbcheckout.payfort.com/FortAPI/paymentPage\" method=\"post\" id=\"\" target=\"myframe\"> <INPUT type=\"hidden\" NAME=\"service_command\" value=\"TOKENIZATION\"> <INPUT type=\"hidden\" NAME=\"language\" value=\" \"> <INPUT type=\"hidden\" NAME=\"merchant_identifier\" value=\"\"> <INPUT type=\"hidden\" NAME=\"access_code\" value=\"\"> <INPUT type=\"hidden\" NAME=\"signature\" value=\"\"> <INPUT type=\"hidden\" NAME=\"return_url\" value=\"\"> <INPUT type=\"hidden\" NAME=\"merchant_reference\" value=\"\"> <input value=\"Send\" type=\"submit\" id=\"form1\"> </form> </body> </html> The above code snippet is an HTML based form that will post a request to PayFORT server. The request parameters are also added in the input tag of the code. However, If you are not familiar with HTML tags and forms then you can checkout this site The parameters are mandatory and are required by PayFORT server to validate, authenticate and provide the tokens for processing of payment The form consists of iframe tag which specifies the style, name of the style (you can give any name to your style), source code location, width and height of the iframe. All these are customizable values which you can provide. The form action tag consists of the endpoints . This will come handy whenever submit action is performed on the page. Once the form is submitted the parameters provided in the form would be sent to the PayFORT server and Endpoints will serve as communication link between your page and PayFORT server. Here is the description of the input parameters: The very first input parameter is the service command Tokenization. This service command will provide the server with a valid command that it should perform once it receives the request. The second input parameter denotes the language. There are two options which you can use. The languages supported by our platform are en/ar . You can provide either english(en) or arabic(ar) in the input parameter value. The third input parameter is merchant identifier and the value of the same can be check in the [backoffice](backoffice.md) The fourth input parameter is the access code and again its value can be found in backoffice. The fifth input parameter is the signature which is a SHA based and can be generated in the backoffice. The sixth input parameter is the return url which the url of the page where you would like to receive the response of the PayFORT server or the response to your request The seventh input parameter is the merchant reference which is nothing but unique order number You need to provide the values of all the input parameters in the value field before your payment page can send request to the PayFORT server Finally the laster input parameter would be a submit parameter which would submit the form and the request would be forwarded to the PayFORT server For more details on Tokens and Tokenization process visit the link What is Custom Payment Form? You can also build your own custom payment form without using default payment template provided by PayFoRT. Figure 1 How it works? You develop your own custom payment details form that collects the card details (credit card number, expiry date, CVV), and sends the request to PayFORT server. PayFort receives the payment details and returns the response which includes the token to your payment processing page. You use the token to complete the [Authorization or Purchase operation](https://docs.payfort.com/docs/api/build/index.html#operations-request). You should develop a form that does not send data to your website but directly submits the form to PayFORT. To learn more about Tokens and Tokenization process visit this [link](tokenization.md) Integration Flow Figure 2 Here is the Integration flow description The customer begins the checkout process on your website. Your website displays the custom payment form to collect the card\u2019s details. Then the Customer enters the card\u2019s details on the payment page. PayFORT checks the card details. PayFORT creates a token for the Customer transaction and sends it to the payment page. The Payment page then sends a JSON request along with the token to PayFORT. In case your page receives from PayFORT server a 3-D Secure URL 3ds_url , and response indicating that a 3ds check is required then: Your payment page redirects the Customer to the ACS to check his card enrollment. The Customer enters authentication data on the ACS platform. The ACS performs authentication of the Customer\u2019s data and sends the authentication results to PayFORT. PayFORT completes the operation based on the 3-D Secure response and returns the response to your payment page. PayFORT sends the payment results to your site. In case of 3ds secure check, PayFort returns status 20: On hold and message 064: 3-D Secure check requested message.For example, PayFort is waiting for your payment page to authenticate the Customer. If the Token is sent by the payment page, it will be generated with the same name sent by the website. Payment processing page, payment form and payment details form all refer to payment page on your site where customer will enter card details.

For retail merchants like you biggest dilemma they face is to download a customized reports. These customized reports includes sales reports, transaction reports, recurring payment reports, bulk sales reports etc. If you are planning to develop your own solution then you can easily use the PayFORT's easy to use reporting API to generate your own customized reports. The Reporting API provides you the feature to generate misc.. reports that can be customized as per your business requirements. You can specify the columns to be included and filters, then download the generated report. The report is limited to 200,000 transactions. PayFORT provides you with two options to generate your reports one is through APIs and another through Backoffice portal. You can develop your own report generation tool and use the PayFORT endpoints to generate and download your own customized report for the business purpose. How it Works? When you are developing the solution for report generation purpose then you need to send request to the PayFORT server using the Endpoints . There will be two requests ( Generate Report and Download Report ) that you will be sending to the PayFORT server. Following steps describes the way Reporting API works: You will submit Generate Report request for report generation. This request also allows you to specify the filters and columns to be included in the downloaded report. The PayFORT server returns the Generate Report response. You will then submit the Download Report request using the same merchant reference which was used to submit Generate Report request Endpoints You can use these PayFORT endpoints for the purpose of testing and going live. If you don't have test account then you can use this link to signup for the test account else you can directly signup for the live account by visiting this link Sandbox POST https://sbpaymentservices.payfort.com/FortAPI/reportingApi Live POST https://paymentservices.payfort.com/FortAPI/reportingApi Parameters Submission Type While submitting your request to PayFORT server using the Endpoints you need to pass parameters in your request. The parameters that you will pass to the server in your request should be REST POST request using JSON Format . Both the requests Generate Report and Download Report will use set of parameters including the column parameters, filter parameters and the key parameters. Generate Report Request Since you will be submitting REST POST using JSON Format, you can refer to the given JSON sample for creating a Generate Report request. The JSON sample also shows the parameters that are required to be sent along the request. Sample JSON Request The above JSON sample is for information purpose and you need to check out the columns parameters, filter parameters and the key parameters (passed within the filters parameters as key value in the above JSON sample) to select the parameters you need to pass in your request. Generate Report Request Sample Below is the sample request for the generation of report in the JSON format to be sent to the PayFORT server. The command GENERATE_REPORT notifies PayFORT server to generate a customized report based on the customized parameters that are sent via request in the JSON format. You have to check the different input parameters and select the parameters based on your requirements. You can opt for receiving the response either in JSON format or the xml format depending on the merchant site's design and architecture.

Not all parameters might be of interest to you, hence select only those parameters which you think are important for your requirement. Providing unnecessary parameters/all parameters at a time to the server can increase the time to generate the report.

Examples of the standard reports on your Fort account are: Installments Report: This report enables you to view all Installments service transactions within a time period. Transactions report: This report enables you to view all transactions performed on your account within a time period. Financial Report: This report enables you to view all successful transactions performed on your account within a time period. Depending on your role scope, the reports vary in terms of their coverage. For example, if you wish to view all the transactions with their different statuses that have been performed on your account within a certain time period, you need to use the Transactions Report section. If you wish to look specifically for the Installments transactions, the Installments Report section will come in handy and in case you are checking only the successful transactions to match them with your settlements for example, the Financial Report section will be the one you should use.

Unfortunately at this time the view is restricted to one account only and can be changed under the \u2018Merchant account\u2019 dropdown. However we are working on releasing more features in the future which will cover this requirement. Based on your assigned User Role, some of the functionalities and system privileges would be enabled or disabled. Examples of the standard reports on your Fort account are: Installments Report: This report enables you to view all Installments service transactions within a time period. Transactions report: This report enables you to view all transactions performed on your account within a time period. Financial Report: This report enables you to view all successful transactions performed on your account within a time period. Depending on your role scope, the reports vary in terms of their coverage. For example, if you wish to view all the transactions with their different statuses that have been performed on your account within a certain time period, you need to use the Transactions Report section. If you wish to look specifically for the Installments transactions, the Installments Report section will come in handy and in case you are checking only the successful transactions to match them with your settlements for example, the Financial Report section will be the one you should use.","title":"Report Generation (BackOffice)"},{"location":"reportingbackoffice/#go-to-full-api","text":"Check out our full API by visiting this link","title":"Go to Full API"},{"location":"reportingbackoffice/#need-further-help","text":"Thanks for using PayFort.com.

Transaction Feedback implementation The Transaction Feedback URL is required to send you the response parameters after processing the transaction on the your side. For the Direct Transaction Feedback, it sends the immediate payments response in all cases , like if the user closed the browser before getting redirected to the Redirection URL due to a drop in the internet connection or he closed the browser during the Redirection , you will create an endpoint which accepts the notifications received from PayFort side as POST Method. For the Notification Transaction Feedback , it\u2019s required to provide you the transaction final status update whenever received , like if the Transaction was pending due to the unavailability for any party , the final update will be pushed to the Notification Feedback URL as POST Method. Beyond whatever your Transaction Feedback URL does with the data received, it must also return a 2xx (like 200 , 201 , etc\u2026) or 302 HTTP status code to update the PayFORT system that the notification was received. If your URL does not return 2xx or 302, the PayFORT will continue to retry the notification for 10 times with 10 seconds in between until it\u2019s properly acknowledged.
