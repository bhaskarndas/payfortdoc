It helps you to accept your Customer's payments on your website. PayFort processes the transaction and returns the results back to the Merchants through invisible redirection. Features No Customer redirection. No PCI-Compliance needed. A replica of your website appearance and your payment flow. How it works - overview 1. The Merchant page (payment details form) will appear to your Customer encapsulated inside an iframe that has the same look and feel of your website. 2. We then receive the payment details and send you confirmation to complete the transaction. Remember - You have the option to redirect the Customer directly to the Merchant Page (payment details form). Integration Flow The Customer begins the checkout process on the Merchant\u2019s website. 2. The Merchant requests to display the Merchant Page (payment details form) encapsulated inside an iframe which has been themed as the Merchant website. Then the Customer enters the card\u2019s details on the Merchant page. 3. PayFort checks the card details. 4. PayFort creates a token for the Customer transaction and sends it to the Merchant. 5. The Merchant then sends a JSON request along with the token to PayFort. 6. In case the Merchant receives from PayFort a 3-D Secure URL \u201c3ds_url\u201d, and response indicating that a 3Ds check is required: a. The Merchant redirects the Customer to the ACS to check his card enrollment. b. The Customer enters authentication data on the ACS platform. c. The ACS performs authentication of the Customer\u2019s data and sends the authentication results to PayFort. Remember - In this case, PayFort returns status \u201c20: On hold\u201d and message \u201c064: 3-D Secure check requested\u201d . For example, PayFort is waiting for the Merchant to authenticate the Customer. 7. PayFort completes the operation based on the 3-D Secure response and returns the response to the Merchant. 8. PayFort sends the payment results to the Merchant. Remember - - If the Merchant includes the \u201ctoken_name\u201d parameter in the request and this Token already has a successful Authorization, then the card number (masked) and expiry date will be displayed in their allocated fields. - If the Token is sent by the Merchant, it will be generated with the same name sent by the Merchant.
