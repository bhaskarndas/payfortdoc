Using PayFort iFrame You can use PayFort iFrame on your website to collect Customer's credit card information. PayFort processes the transaction and returns the results back to the your site through invisible redirection. Please refer figure 1. Figure 1 - Using PayFort iFrame How it Works - Overview 1. The payment details form will appear to your Customer encapsulated inside an iframe that has the same look and feel of as that of your website. 2. PayFort then receives the payment details and sends you the confirmation to complete the transaction. Note - You have the option to redirect the Customer directly to the payment details form. Integration Flow The Customer begins the checkout process on your website. The Payment details form encapsulated inside iFrame is displayed on your payment processing page. Then the Customer enters the card\u2019s details on the Merchant page. PayFort checks the card details. PayFort creates a token for the Customer transaction and sends it to the integration page. The Payment processing page then sends a JSON request along with the token to PayFort. In case your website receives from PayFort a 3-D Secure URL \u201c3ds_url\u201d, and response indicating that a 3Ds check is required: a. Your payment processing page redirects the Customer to the ACS to check his card enrollment. b. The Customer enters authentication data on the ACS platform. c. The ACS performs authentication of the Customer\u2019s data and sends the authentication results to PayFort. PayFort completes the operation based on the 3-D Secure response and returns the response to your integration page. PayFort sends the payment results to your site. Note - -In this case, PayFort returns status \u201c20: On hold\u201d and message \u201c064: 3-D Secure check requested\u201d . For example, PayFort is waiting for your payment processing page to authenticate the Customer.* If you include the \u201ctoken_name\u201d parameter in the request and this Token already has a successful Authorization, then the card number (masked) and expiry date will be displayed in their allocated fields.

PayFort receives the payment details and returns the response which includes the Token to your website. 3. You use the token to complete the Authorization or Purchase operation . Note - You should develop a form that does not send data to your website but directly submits the form to PayFort.* Integration Flow 1. The Customer begins the checkout process on your website. 2. Your website displays the custom payment form to collect the card\u2019s details. Then the Customer enters the card\u2019s details on the payment page. 3. PayFort validates the card format. 4. PayFort creates a token for the card details and sends it back to your website. 5. Your website stores the Token and proceeds with the transaction. 6. Your website sends a payment request along with the Token to PayFort. 7. PayFort sends your website the 3-D Secure URL, and response indicating that a check is required: a. Payment form redirects the Customer to check his card enrollment. b.

How to add the Tokenization service on the Integration Page channel? The Tokenization service is applicable to be integrated through the Merchant Page Channel through the below steps: 1. The Customer processes the first PURCHASE/ AUTHORIZATION payment successfully. 2. The Merchant will receive a token_name in the response. This token_name should be considered as a permanent token name, and it can be used in the future customer\u2019s payments by submitting the token_name in the next PURCHASE/ AUTHORIZATION payment with card_security_code parameter. 3. No need to open the Merchant Page to fill all the card details again in the next checkouts. If the Customer wants to update/ delete his card, you should check Update Token section. Note Please refer to section FORT Tokenization Service for more details about the token name parameter. Integration Page Customization This is a list with all customizable CSS classes on the basic merchant page: The Wrapper class: responsible for the total width of the form container and the background. The Container class: responsible for the form\u2019s shape and width. The Popover class: responsible for the error messages. The Half-container class: used to merge the date and CVV fields into one block if needed. The Input class: is the container of each single input field. The Pay class: responsible for the submit button. The Visa/ MasterCard classes: used to change the color of the Visa/ MasterCard colors. Note - You can always create multiple theme files that will enable you to switch freely and easily between them when necessary. Note - \u201cTheme\u201d files can be uploaded from the back-office using the Payment Page template screen.","title":"Integrations"},{"location":"Integrations/#integrations","text":"There are two ways by which you can achieve integrations as mentioned: Using PayFort iFrame .

Merchant Page Customization Merchant Page This integration uses PayFort inline frame (iframe) to collect Customer's credit card information. It helps you to accept your Customer's payments on your website. PayFort processes the transaction and returns the results back to the Merchants through invisible redirection. Features No Customer redirection. No PCI-Compliance needed. A replica of your website appearance and your payment flow. How it works - overview 1. The Merchant page (payment details form) will appear to your Customer encapsulated inside an iframe that has the same look and feel of your website. 2. We then receive the payment details and send you confirmation to complete the transaction. Note - You have the option to redirect the Customer directly to the Merchant Page (payment details form). Integration Flow The Customer begins the checkout process on the Merchant\u2019s website. 2. The Merchant requests to display the Merchant Page (payment details form) encapsulated inside an iframe which has been themed as the Merchant website. Then the Customer enters the card\u2019s details on the Merchant page. 3. PayFort checks the card details. 4. PayFort creates a token for the Customer transaction and sends it to the Merchant. 5. The Merchant then sends a JSON request along with the token to PayFort. 6. In case the Merchant receives from PayFort a 3-D Secure URL \u201c3ds_url\u201d, and response indicating that a 3Ds check is required: a. The Merchant redirects the Customer to the ACS to check his card enrollment. b. The Customer enters authentication data on the ACS platform. c. The ACS performs authentication of the Customer\u2019s data and sends the authentication results to PayFort. Note - In this case, PayFort returns status \u201c20: On hold\u201d and message \u201c064: 3-D Secure check requested\u201d . For example, PayFort is waiting for the Merchant to authenticate the Customer. 7. PayFort completes the operation based on the 3-D Secure response and returns the response to the Merchant. 8. PayFort sends the payment results to the Merchant. Note - - If the Merchant includes the \u201ctoken_name\u201d parameter in the request and this Token already has a successful Authorization, then the card number (masked) and expiry date will be displayed in their allocated fields. - If the Token is sent by the Merchant, it will be generated with the same name sent by the Merchant.

This token_name should be considered as a permanent token name, and it can be used in the future customer\u2019s payments by submitting the token_name in the next PURCHASE/ AUTHORIZATION payment with card_security_code parameter. 3. No need to open the Merchant Page to fill all the card details again in the next checkouts. If the Customer wants to update/ delete his card, you should check Update Token section. Note Please refer to section FORT Tokenization Service for more details about the token name parameter.
