Merchant Page Customization Merchant Page This integration uses PayFort inline frame (iframe) to collect Customer's credit card information. It helps you to accept your Customer's payments on your website. PayFort processes the transaction and returns the results back to the Merchants through invisible redirection. Features No Customer redirection. No PCI-Compliance needed. A replica of your website appearance and your payment flow. How it works - overview 1. The Merchant page (payment details form) will appear to your Customer encapsulated inside an iframe that has the same look and feel of your website. 2. We then receive the payment details and send you confirmation to complete the transaction. Note - You have the option to redirect the Customer directly to the Merchant Page (payment details form). Integration Flow The Customer begins the checkout process on the Merchant\u2019s website. 2. The Merchant requests to display the Merchant Page (payment details form) encapsulated inside an iframe which has been themed as the Merchant website. Then the Customer enters the card\u2019s details on the Merchant page. 3. PayFort checks the card details. 4. PayFort creates a token for the Customer transaction and sends it to the Merchant. 5. The Merchant then sends a JSON request along with the token to PayFort. 6. In case the Merchant receives from PayFort a 3-D Secure URL \u201c3ds_url\u201d, and response indicating that a 3Ds check is required: a. The Merchant redirects the Customer to the ACS to check his card enrollment. b. The Customer enters authentication data on the ACS platform. c. The ACS performs authentication of the Customer\u2019s data and sends the authentication results to PayFort. Note - In this case, PayFort returns status \u201c20: On hold\u201d and message \u201c064: 3-D Secure check requested\u201d . For example, PayFort is waiting for the Merchant to authenticate the Customer. 7. PayFort completes the operation based on the 3-D Secure response and returns the response to the Merchant. 8. PayFort sends the payment results to the Merchant. Note - - If the Merchant includes the \u201ctoken_name\u201d parameter in the request and this Token already has a successful Authorization, then the card number (masked) and expiry date will be displayed in their allocated fields. - If the Token is sent by the Merchant, it will be generated with the same name sent by the Merchant.

PayFort provides easy to use iFrame which can be easily integrated with your payment form. It takes the look and feel of your merchant site and accepts payments from major credit cards including MADA, VISA, Mastercard, Diners etc. Figure 1 - Using PayFort iFrame for web How it Works 1. The payment details form will appear to your Customer encapsulated inside an iframe that has the same look and feel as that of your website. 2. PayFort then receives the payment details and sends you the confirmation to complete the transaction. Note - You have the option to redirect the Customer directly to the payment details form. Integration Flow Figure 2 : Integration Flow using iFrame The customer begins the checkout process on your website. The payment page encapsulated inside iFrame is displayed. Then the Customer enters the card\u2019s details on the payment page. PayFort checks the card details. PayFort creates a token for the Customer transaction and sends it to the payment page. The Payment page then sends a JSON request along with the token to PayFort. In case your page receives from PayFort a 3-D Secure URL \u201c3ds_url\u201d, and response indicating that a 3Ds check is required: a. Your payment page redirects the Customer to the ACS to check his card enrollment. b. The Customer enters authentication data on the ACS platform. c. The ACS performs authentication of the Customer\u2019s data and sends the authentication results to PayFort. PayFort completes the operation based on the 3-D Secure response and returns the response to your payment page. PayFort sends the payment results to your site.

How to add the Tokenization service on the Payment Page? The Tokenization service is applicable to be integrated through the payment page through the below steps: 1. The Customer processes the first PURCHASE/ AUTHORIZATION payment successfully. 2. The payment page will receive a token_name in the response. This token_name should be considered as a permanent token name, and it can be used in the future customer\u2019s payments by submitting the token_name in the next PURCHASE/ AUTHORIZATION payment with card_security_code parameter. 3. No need to open the Payment Details Form to fill all the card details again in the next checkouts. If the Customer wants to update/ delete his card, you should check Update Token section. Note Please refer to section FORT Tokenization Service for more details about the token name parameter.
