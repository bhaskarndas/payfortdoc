Merchant Page Customization Merchant Page This integration uses PayFort inline frame (iframe) to collect Customer's credit card information. It helps you to accept your Customer's payments on your website. PayFort processes the transaction and returns the results back to the Merchants through invisible redirection. Features No Customer redirection. No PCI-Compliance needed. A replica of your website appearance and your payment flow. How it works - overview 1. The Merchant page (payment details form) will appear to your Customer encapsulated inside an iframe that has the same look and feel of your website. 2. We then receive the payment details and send you confirmation to complete the transaction. Note - You have the option to redirect the Customer directly to the Merchant Page (payment details form). Integration Flow The Customer begins the checkout process on the Merchant\u2019s website. 2. The Merchant requests to display the Merchant Page (payment details form) encapsulated inside an iframe which has been themed as the Merchant website. Then the Customer enters the card\u2019s details on the Merchant page. 3. PayFort checks the card details. 4. PayFort creates a token for the Customer transaction and sends it to the Merchant. 5. The Merchant then sends a JSON request along with the token to PayFort. 6. In case the Merchant receives from PayFort a 3-D Secure URL \u201c3ds_url\u201d, and response indicating that a 3Ds check is required: a. The Merchant redirects the Customer to the ACS to check his card enrollment. b. The Customer enters authentication data on the ACS platform. c. The ACS performs authentication of the Customer\u2019s data and sends the authentication results to PayFort. Note - In this case, PayFort returns status \u201c20: On hold\u201d and message \u201c064: 3-D Secure check requested\u201d . For example, PayFort is waiting for the Merchant to authenticate the Customer. 7. PayFort completes the operation based on the 3-D Secure response and returns the response to the Merchant. 8.

Figure 1 How it works - overview You develop your own custom payment details form that collects the card details (credit card number, expiry date, CVV), and sends the request to PayFort. PayFort receives the payment details and returns the response which includes the Token to your payment processing page. You use the token to complete the Authorization or Purchase operation . Note - You should develop a form that does not send data to your website but directly submits the form to PayFort.* Integration Flow Figure 2 The Customer begins the checkout process on your website. Your website displays the custom payment form to collect the card\u2019s details. Then the Customer enters the card\u2019s details on the payment page. PayFort validates the card format. PayFort creates a token for the card details and sends it back to your payment page. Payment page stores the Token and proceeds with the transaction. Payment page sends a payment request along with the Token to PayFort. PayFort sends the 3-D Secure URL, and response indicating that a check is required: Payment page redirects the Customer to check his card enrollment. The Customer enters authentication data. 3-D Secure authentication is completed and PayFort receives the authentication results. Note - In this case, PayFort returns status \u201c20: On hold\u201d and message \u201c064: 3-D Secure check requested\u201d . For example, PayFort is waiting for the payment page to authenticate the Customer. PayFort completes the operation based on the 3-D Secure response and returns the response to the website. The payment results are displayed to the Customer. Note - If the Token is sent by the payment page, it will be generated with the same name sent by the website. Payment processing page, payment form and payment details form all refer to payment page on your site where customer will enter card details.

How to add the Tokenization service on the Payment Page? The Tokenization service is applicable to be integrated through the payment page through the below steps: 1. The Customer processes the first PURCHASE/ AUTHORIZATION payment successfully. 2. The payment page will receive a token_name in the response. This token_name should be considered as a permanent token name, and it can be used in the future customer\u2019s payments by submitting the token_name in the next PURCHASE/ AUTHORIZATION payment with card_security_code parameter. 3. No need to open the Payment Details Form to fill all the card details again in the next checkouts. If the Customer wants to update/ delete his card, you should check Update Token section. Note Please refer to section FORT Tokenization Service for more details about the token name parameter.
