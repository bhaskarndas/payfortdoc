<h2 id="using-payfort-iframe"><a name="iframe"></a>Using PayFort iFrame</h2>
<p><em>PayFort</em> <strong><em>iFrame</em></strong> help you to create a payment form which is customizable. It gives the customer to provide their payment details on your site checkout page or in your mobile based app. Once the details are entered PayFort generates a secure single use token through tokenization process. This token can be used to request a payment without the need to store any customer's payment information in your site.</p>
<p><em>PayFort</em> processes the transaction and returns the results back to the your site through invisible redirection.

<h3 id="how-it-works-overview">How it Works - Overview</h3>
<p><strong>1.</strong> The payment details form will appear to your Customer encapsulated inside an iframe that has the same look and feel of as that of your website.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> PayFort then receives the payment details and sends you the confirmation to complete the transaction.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The customer begins the checkout process on your website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The payment page encapsulated inside iFrame is displayed.  Then the Customer enters the card’s details on the payment page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PayFort checks the card details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PayFort creates a token for the Customer transaction and sends it to the payment page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Payment page then sends a <a href="https://docs.payfort.com/docs/api/build/index.html#merchant-page-operations">JSON request</a> along with the token to PayFort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In case your page receives from PayFort a 3-D Secure URL “3ds_url”, and response indicating that a 3Ds check is required:<br>
   <strong>a.</strong> Your payment page redirects the Customer to the ACS to check his card enrollment.<br><strong>b.</strong> The Customer enters authentication data on the ACS platform.<br><strong>c.</strong> The ACS performs authentication of the Customer’s data and sends the authentication results to PayFort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PayFort completes the operation based on the 3-D Secure response and returns the response to your payment page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PayFort sends the payment results to your site.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><em>Note</em></strong> -</p>
<ul>
<li>In this case, PayFort returns<em> </em><em>status “20: On hold”</em><em> </em>and<em> </em><em>message “064: 3-D Secure check requested”</em><em>. </em>For example, PayFort is waiting for your payment page to authenticate the Customer.*</li>
<li><em>If you include the “token_name” parameter in the request and this Token already has a successful Authorization, then the card number (masked) and expiry date will be displayed in their allocated fields.</em></li>
<li>If the Token is sent by you, it will be generated with the same name as sent by your page.</li>
<li>Payment processing page, payment form and payment details form all refer to payment page on your site where customer will enter card details.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="2-using-custom-payment-form">2. Using Custom Payment Form</h2>
<p>You can also design and develop your own custom for for collecting the card details. The card details are sent directly to PayFort and substituted with Token. You can then use this Token to complete the transaction.</p>
<p><img alt="custom-payment" src="../img/custom-payment-form.png" /></p>

<h3 id="how-it-works-overview_1">How it works - overview</h3>

<p>The Tokenization service is applicable to be integrated through the payment page through the below steps:
<strong>1.</strong> The Customer processes the first PURCHASE/ AUTHORIZATION payment successfully.
<strong>2.</strong> The payment page will receive a token_name in the response. This token_name should be considered as a permanent token name, and it can be used in the future customer’s payments by submitting the token_name in the next PURCHASE/ AUTHORIZATION payment with card_security_code parameter.
<strong>3.</strong> No need to open the Payment Details Form to fill all the card details again in the next checkouts.</p>
<p>If the Customer wants to update/ delete his card, you should check <a href="https://docs.payfort.com/docs/api/build/index.html#update-token-service">Update Token</a> section.</p>
<p><strong><em>Note</em></strong>
Please refer to section <a href="https://docs.payfort.com/docs/api/build/index.html#fort-tokenization-service">FORT Tokenization Service</a> for more details about the token name parameter.</p>
