# Report Generation (BackOffice)

------

You can also generate various reports through the payFORT Backoffice.

There is no limitation on the date range and you can view transactions readily for the same day, day before that and the last month by using the options from the drop down list. You can also customize your date range using the ‘Custom Range’ option. Please ensure you click on ‘Apply’ after selecting the desired range.

<div class="alert alert-info"><i class="fa fa-info">&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Unfortunately at this time the view is restricted to one account only and can be changed under the ‘Merchant account’ dropdown. However we are working on releasing more features in the future which will cover this requirement.</div>

Based on your assigned User Role, some of the functionalities and system privileges would be enabled or disabled. Examples of the standard reports on your Fort account are:



**Installments Report:** This report enables you to view all Installments service transactions within a time period.

**Financial Report:** This report enables you to view all successful transactions performed on your account within a time period.

<div class="alert alert-info"><i class="fa fa-info">&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Depending on your role scope, the reports vary in terms of their coverage. For example, if you wish to view all the transactions with their different statuses that have been performed on your account within a certain time period, you need to use the Transactions Report section. If you wish to look specifically for the Installments transactions, the Installments Report section will come in handy and in case you are checking only the successful transactions to match them with your settlements for example, the Financial Report section will be the one you should use.</div>
