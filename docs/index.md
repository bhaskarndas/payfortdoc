## Using PayFORT iFrame

------

*PayFORT ***iFrame*** helps you to create a customizable payment form. It gives the customer freedom to provide their payment details on your site's checkout page. Once the details are entered PayFORT generates a secure single use token through tokenization process. This token can be used to request a payment without the need to store any customer's payment information in your site.

 *PayFORT* processes the transaction and returns the results back to the your site through invisible redirection.
