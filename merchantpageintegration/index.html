    <p>Merchant Page Integration allows you to accept the Customer’s payments in their websites by collecting their credit card information using a PayFort inline frame (iframe). PayFort processes the transaction and returns the results back to the Merchants through invisible redirection.</p>
<h2>Endpoints</h2>

<hr>

<p>An <em>endpoint</em> is one end of a communication channel and your merchant site will communicate with the PayFORT resources using Endpoints. For PayFORT <mark>APIs</mark>, an <em>endpoint</em> includes a URL of PayFORT server or service. </p>

     <h3>What is iFrame for Web?</h3> 
     <hr>
    <p>
        You can setup payment form and start accepting payments within few minutes with the help of iFrame. PayFORT provides easy to use iFrame which can be easily integrated with your payment form. It takes the look and feel of your merchant site and accepts payments from major credit cards including MADA, VISA, Mastercard, etc. You develop your site in any technology of your choice and integrate the iFrame in your html based checkout page. The PayFORT iframe takes the look and feel as that of your website.

<p>Figure 1 - Using PayFORT iFrame for web</p></p>
<h3>How it Works?</h3>

<p><hr>
<ol>
<li> Your checkout page will display an integrated PayFORT iFrame to your Customer that has the same look and feel as that of your website.</li>
<li>Customer fills his/her payment details in the checkout page.</li>
<li>PayFORT server receives the payment details and validates the same.</li>
<li>PayFORT then sends a token to your checkout page to complete the transaction.</li></ol></p>
<p><div class="alert alert-info"><i class="fa fa-info">&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>You have the option to redirect the Customer directly to the checkout page.</div>

<h3>Integration Flow</h3>

<p><hr>
<img src="img/image-20200212214741915.png" alt="PayFORT iFrame Integration Flow"></p>
<p>Figure 2 : Integration Flow using iFrame</p>

<p>Here is the description of the PayFORT iFrame Integration workflow :</p>

<ol>
    <li>The customer begins the checkout process on your website.</li>
    <li>The payment page with integrated iFrame is displayed. The Customer then enters the card’s details on the payment page.</li>
    <li>PayFORT checks the card details.</li>
    <li>PayFORT creates a token for the Customer transaction and sends it to the payment page.</li>
    <li>The Payment page then sends a <a href="https://docs.payfort.com/docs/api/build/index.html#merchant-page-operations">JSON request</a> along with the token to PayFORT.</li>
    <li>In case your page receives from PayFORT server a 3-D Secure URL <mark>3ds_url</mark>, and response indicating that a 3ds check is required then:</br></br><div class="alert alert-info">
<ol>
  <li>Your payment page redirects the Customer to the ACS to check his card enrollment.</li>
  <li>The Customer enters authentication data on the ACS platform.</li>
  <li>The ACS performs authentication of the Customer’s data and sends the authentication results to PayFORT.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<li>PayFORT completes the operation based on the 3-D Secure response and returns the response to your payment page.</li>
 <li>PayFORT sends the payment results to your site.</li></br>
<div class="container">
<div class="alert alert-info"><i class="fa fa-info">&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>In case of 3ds secure check, PayFort returns status <mark>20: On hold</mark>and message <mark>064: 3-D Secure check requested</mark><p>message.For example, PayFort is waiting for your payment page to authenticate the Customer.</p></div>

<div class="alert alert-info"><i class="fa fa-info">&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>If you include the <mark>token_name</mark> parameter in the request and this Token already has a successful Authorization,<p> then the card number (masked) and expiry date will be displayed in their allocated fields.</p></div>

<div class="alert alert-info"><i class="fa fa-info">&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>If the Token is sent by you, it will be generated with the same name as sent by your page.</div>

<div class="alert alert-info"><i class="fa fa-info">&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Payment processing page, payment form and payment details form all refer to payment page on your site <p>where customer will enter card details.</p></div>
</div>

<h3>Integrate iFrames to Payment Page</h3><hr>

<p>If you are planning to use PayFORT iFrames then you can use the endpoints&nbsp;<a href=""#endpoints"><i class="fa fa-anchor">&nbsp;</i></a>Endpoints for testing and and also for going live. You can use programming language of your choice or what your site uses and can use the iFrame in your html based check out page.</p>

<h4>Before you start</h4>

<p>Make sure you have your <mark>access_code</mark>. Refer to Figure 3<a href=#figure-3"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>. You can find it in the <a href="https://fort.payfort.com/account/MerchantManagement/EntitySecurity">backoffice</a>, under Integration Settings > <bold>Security Settings > Access Code</bold>. If you don't have an account with us yet, you can create a test account by visiting the <a href="https://www.payfort.com/test-account/">Link</a>. You can also get started with an active account by visiting this <a href="https://www.payfort.com/get-started/">link</a>. Once you signup you will get the access to the Backoffice. You can check out more about navigating through backoffice by visiting this <a href="backoffice.md">link</a></p>

<a name="figure3"></a><br/>
<img src="img\integrationsettings2.png" alt="Access Code Generation">


<p>Figure 3 : Access Code Generation</p>

The Payment Page Template available in the backoffice provides you the feature to create a payment processing page using PayFort iFrame. Refer to the Figure 4  <a href="#figure4"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>

<h4>Sample iFrame code snippet</h4><hr>

<p>The following sample code snippet is the start of the payment process and allows you to tokenize a customer's sensitive card information using iFrames. </p>


<pre><code class="html">&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;iframe  style=&quot;border:5px dotted red&quot; name=&quot;myframe&quot; src = &quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;600&quot;&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;form action=&quot;https://sbcheckout.payfort.com/FortAPI/paymentPage&quot; method=&quot;post&quot; id=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;myframe&quot;&gt;

&lt;INPUT type=&quot;hidden&quot; NAME=&quot;service_command&quot; value=&quot;TOKENIZATION&quot;&gt;

&lt;INPUT type=&quot;hidden&quot; NAME=&quot;language&quot; value=&quot; &quot;&gt;

&lt;INPUT type=&quot;hidden&quot; NAME=&quot;merchant_identifier&quot; value=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;INPUT type=&quot;hidden&quot; NAME=&quot;access_code&quot; value=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;INPUT type=&quot;hidden&quot; NAME=&quot;signature&quot; value=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;INPUT type=&quot;hidden&quot; NAME=&quot;return_url&quot; value=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;INPUT type=&quot;hidden&quot; NAME=&quot;merchant_reference&quot; value=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;input value=&quot;Send&quot; type=&quot;submit&quot; id=&quot;form1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>


<p>The above code snippet is an HTML based form that will post a request to PayFORT server. The request parameters are also added in the input tag of the code. However, If you are not familiar with HTML tags and forms then you can checkout this <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">site</a></p>

<div class="alert alert-info">&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-info">&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>The parameters are mandatory and are required by PayFORT server to validate, authenticate and provide the tokens for processing of payment</div>

<p>The form consists of iframe tag which specifies the style, name of the style (you can give any name to your style), source code location, width and height of the iframe. All these are customizable values which you can provide. </p>

<p>The form action tag consists of the endpoints &nbsp; <a href="#endpoints"><i class="fa fa-anchor"></i></a>. This will come handy whenever submit action is performed on the page. Once the form is submitted the parameters provided in the form would be sent to the PayFORT server and Endpoints will serve as communication link between your page and PayFORT server.</p>

<p>Here is the description of the input parameters:</p>
<ol>
<li>The very first input parameter is the service command Tokenization. This service command will provide the server with a valid command that it should perform once it receives the request.</li>
<li>The second input parameter denotes the language. There are two options which you can use. The languages supported by our platform are <mark><bold>en/ar</bold></mark>. You can provide either english(en) or arabic(ar) in the input parameter value.</li>
<li>The third input parameter is merchant identifier and the value of the same can be check in the [backoffice](backoffice.md)</li>
<li>The fourth input parameter is the access code and again its value can be found in backoffice.</li>
<li>The fifth input parameter is the signature which is a SHA based and can be generated in the backoffice.</li>
<li>The sixth input parameter is the return url which the url of the page where you would like to receive the response of the PayFORT server or the response to your request</li>
<li>The seventh input parameter is the merchant reference which is nothing but unique order number</li>
<li>You need to provide the values of all the input parameters in the value field before your payment page can send request to the PayFORT server</li>
<li>Finally the laster input parameter would be a submit parameter which would submit the form and the request would be forwarded to the PayFORT server</li>
</ol>

<h3>What is Custom Payment Form?</h3><hr></p>
<p>You can also build your own custom payment form without using default payment template provided by PayFoRT.</p>

<p><img src="img\custom-payment-form.png" a;t="Custom Payment Page">

<h3>How it works?</h3><hr></p>
<p><ol>
<li>You develop your own custom payment details form that collects the card details (credit card number, expiry date, CVV), and sends the request to PayFORT server.</li>
<li>PayFort receives the payment details and returns the response which includes the token to your payment processing page.</li>
<li>You use the token to complete the [Authorization or Purchase operation](https://docs.payfort.com/docs/api/build/index.html#operations-request).</li>

   <div class="alert alert-info"><i class="fa fa-info">&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>You should develop a form that does not send data to your website but directly submits the form to PayFORT.</div>

<h4>Payment Page Customization</h4>

<p>When you begin designing your own custom payment page you will also need to style your custom payment page so that it is in line with the look and feel of your website. Inorder to style your custom payment page you will require CSS files and within those files you need use the css classes. If you are new to HTML and CSS don't worry you can visit this [link](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) to learn about HTML/CSS.</p>

<p>This is a list with all customizable CSS classes on the basic payment page:</p>

<p>- **The `Wrapper` class**</p>

  <p>It is responsible for the total width of the form container and the background.</p>

<p>- **The `Container` class**</p>

  <p>It is responsible for the form’s shape and width.</p>

<p>- **The `Popover` class**</p>

 <p> It is responsible for the error messages.</p>

<p>- **The `Half-container` class**</p>

  <p>It is used to merge the date and CVV fields into one block if needed.</p>

<p>- **The `Input` class**</p>

  <p>It is the container of each single input field.</p>

<p>- **The `Pay` class**</p>

  <p>It is responsible for the submit button.</p>

<p>- **The `Visa/ MasterCard` classes**</p>

 <p> It is used to change the color of the Visa/ MasterCard colors.</p>

  <div class="alert alert-info"><i class="fa fa-info">&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>You can always create multiple theme files that will enable you to switch freely and easily between them when necessary.Theme files offer you the flexibility to change the look and feel of your page.</div>

  <div class="alert alert-info"><i class="fa fa-info">&nbsp;&nbsp;</i><mark>Theme</mark> files can be uploaded from the back-office using the Payment Page template screen.</div>
